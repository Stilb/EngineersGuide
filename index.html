When God arrived on that first week above the oceanic Earth, there was no sun, no moon, no stars, and probably no atmosphere. It was dark, and it was cold[1]. Without the sun to warm the water or the atmosphere to trap the heat, if nothing intervened, the ocean would rapidly begin to approach the temperature of space. The freezing would start immediately with the surface turning to ice in an instant. From there, the sheet would thicken inward toward the crust. As it froze, the dissolved salt in the water would be pushed out, increasing the salinity of the ocean below and depressing the freezing temperature ever further. Left on its own, it would have taken 31 hours for the ocean to freeze into a 1.3 mile thick sheet of ice. At this point with nearly 18% salt concentration beneath it, the water would be 12 times saltier than oceans today and the freezing temperature would have dropped to 26 degrees. This thin band of water, only 2000 feet deep would be trapped between cold ice and a hot core, and would stay liquid as the heat from the core balanced the energy lost to space. [2]
But this is not what happened. When God arrived, the Earth is described using terms for liquid water. The phrase, “watery deep” is found in only two other places in the Bible, once when Noah’s ark rode over the mountains on flood waters, and once again when Jonah was thrown overboard into the storm on the Mediterranean Sea. Given the temperature of space, for an ocean to keep from freezing, it must have been very warm, probably with an average temperature of about 76 degrees. From there, three more days of cooling would bring the ocean to a tropical warmth, just in time for the first fish.[3]
Hovering above the waters, God looked about at the new planet, and created light.

HALF OF EARTH LIGHT, HALF OF IT DARK (Subtitle: Day 1)

On this first day of creation, it seems that the light came from God. The sun wouldn’t be created until three days later. 
The Earth was still a bare sphere of water the next morning when God pulled up atmosphere from the surface. When I was a boy, the word “firmament” was always translated “expanse” and explained as atmosphere, but it may well have been more than this. Today, the atmosphere of the earth begins at sea level and continues in one form or another getting thinner and thinner until it become only slightly less of a vacuum than space. Scientists today declare the edge of space to be 36 miles up, at the outer edge of the troposphere. This atmosphere is held in place to a small extent by gravity, but mostly by the Earth’s magnetic field. As the sun’s radiation strikes the particles in the atmosphere, they either gain or are stripped of electrons, becoming an electrically charged plasma that is then magnetic. Without this energy, the upper atmosphere would gradually diffuse into space. 
But this may not have been the case on day two. Rather than discuss a gradient of particles, the Bible seems to describe the scene as if God casts a bubble around the Earth, somewhat above the water, and fills the space in between the bubble and the surface of the water with atmosphere.  Specifically God says that He separated the “waters above from the waters beneath”. 
Though the evidence for this sphere of icy water above the atmosphere is speculative at best, there are a few interesting effects. If, in fact, the Earth was surrounded by a sphere of ice above the atmosphere, the light from the not-then-created sun would be diffuse instead of direct. The ice would refract the rays, wrapping them around the upper atmosphere and increasing the light to the polar regions. Furthermore, experiments with light through ice have shown that water filters and scatters blue light best, so the sky would show a faint pink hue instead of the blue expected today. 
The water above the atmosphere would push down on the particles in the air, increasing the pressure at sea level and providing hyperbaric conditions that would increase the health and growth abilities of both plants and animals as it forces more oxygen into the blood increasing the speed of healing and decreasing the body’s need to switch to anaerobic metabolism. Today, this is the same practice used by therapists to help people heal more quickly from injuries[4]. 
This is all speculation as the bubble, if it ever existed, does not any more. Neither satellites nor men traveling to the moon had to pass through a barrier of water on their way to space, but this does not in itself preclude the past existence of such a thing (and it must be pointed out that the Bible story does not require such a bubble to have existed). If the water above the atmosphere did exist, it likely ceased to in Genesis 11 when God opened the “windows of heaven” and poured water out on the Earth[5]. 

The days of creation went quickly, much like any busy week might today. On the first day God created light. On day two, He made an atmosphere above the sea. On the third day, land was pulled up from the ocean floor, and the first plants began to grow. Day four introduced the sun, the moon, and the stars, day five the fish and birds, and day six the mammals and man. Finally, on day seven, God rested and enjoyed all that He had done.
